<h1 align= "center"><STRONG>Definition of Pollution</STRONG></h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> -Pollution is defined as the process of introducing harmful or poisonous substances into the natural environment.<br>
-Americans discard 180 million gallons of used motor oil each year.<br>
-The shipping industry causes 35% of oil pollution.<br>
-Plastics form 65 to 90% of garbage in the ocean.<br>
	-165 tons of plastic in the ocean (2017 survey).<br>
- 20-25% of toxic chemicals end up in the ocean.<br>
- human wastewater (from toilets) put unwanted nutrients in the ocean.<br>
- Soaps and detergents in laundry and food preparation (in coastal cities) end up in the oceans.<br>
- 80% of sewage in the Meditarrean Sea in untreated<br>
Untreated sewage is a mixture of human feces and waste water (bathing, washing, and cleaning). It can not only be harmful to sea creatures but also to humans. It can contain waterborne pathogens that can cause serious human illness.</p>

<h2 align= "center"><STRONG>Sunscreen and Swimmer</STRONG></h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"align= "center"> The chemicals in sunscreen wash off in the ocean and coats coral reefs and plant-life and it suffocates them. Time Magazine reportes 4000 to 6000 tons of sunscreen lotion entered coral areas each year by 2013. Oxybenzone and other chemicals (in sunscreen) affect algae, sea urchins, fish, and mammals living in the ocean. Some areas have more than ten times the allowable level of oxybenzone in oceans. Organic sunscreens that contain plant-based oils eucalyptus and lavender which have insect repellent or bees-wax most likely hasfungicide or insecticides. These chemicals can be harmful to marine invertebrates.<br>

<h2 align= "center"><STRONG>Causes of Pollution</STRONG></h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"align= "center"> Chemicals from industries and from the fertilizers and other farm products are carried by runoff water into the ocean waters. Nuclear waste, which is mostly produced from industrial, medical, and also scientific procedures that use radioactive material can pollute oceans. Plastic can accumulate in oceans and can be ingested by marine animals. oil spills can pollute the ocean by forming a layer on the water that can prevent oxygen circulation, so the lack of oxygen can destroy marine life over a long period of time.<br>
